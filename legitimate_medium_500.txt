25723	5705764167	@veganza Oh, geez. If it lasts longer than tomorrow I think I'll take an antihistamine. It's driving me insane. :-/	2009-11-14 03:34:36
25723	5705751774	I just called in sick for tomorrow at the markets. I hate to miss a day of possibly really good sales. *sigh* Damn hives. :-/	2009-11-14 03:33:31
25723	5705143547	I'm going to do another Nana May's treatment followed by a cold shower. I hate hives. *makes grumpy, annoyed sighing noise*	2009-11-14 02:40:14
25723	5705115001	I'm missing out on a friend's house cooling party tonight because of these damn hives. I'm trying to decide if I can work tomorrow. :-/	2009-11-14 02:37:42
25723	5705101713	@LowVibe75 UTI is causing it, I think.	2009-11-14 02:36:33
25723	5705099002	@UStupidBitch I have things to use already, but they're all only temporary.	2009-11-14 02:36:19
25723	5705025180	@PeterBlackQUT Um. What? How do you use it? What's it for? It's cool, I'm just not sure why. LOL! :-D	2009-11-14 02:30:43
25723	5705006393	I know I've coping with it pretty well all day, but ..  GAH! THESE HIVES ARE DRIVING ME INSANE!!  .. Okay. I feel a bit better now.	2009-11-14 02:29:16
25723	5704878276	@catebolt Not me (working, + no money), but I hope you have an awesome time! You guys need this good thing. :-)	2009-11-14 02:18:22
25723	5704860586	@BillHarper Just had a thought. It works just as well with using prepare=verb & practise=verb, too.	2009-11-14 02:16:52
25723	5704841310	@BillHarper NP. :-) That's the _only_ one I've found that works for me with practice/practise.	2009-11-14 02:15:12
25723	5704819558	The UTI seems to be working its way out through the hives. If I took an antihistamine, maybe the UTI would return. Frankly, I prefer hives.	2009-11-14 02:13:24
25723	5704795081	Wish I'd thought of that. :-D RT @NicoleJensen: Lawyer sends "meep" to school principal who banned "meep." http://pop.is/d7k	2009-11-14 02:11:24

25723	5704448681	@Alybean The infection itself. I'm only treating it by taking Ural. That seems to be doing the job with the UTI.	2009-11-14 01:43:34
25723	5704325649	@Alybean Pretty sure it's from the UTI.	2009-11-14 01:33:50
25723	5704252656	I still have fresh itchy welts popping up. They're not coming thick & fast like they were last night, though. That was awful. #hives	2009-11-14 01:28:14

25723	5703019130	@BillHarper Best trick: ice=noun practice=noun. If you can replace practice/ise with preparation (also noun), then use practice. Make sense?	2009-11-14 00:03:37

25723	5700846124	A new Brisbane events website: http://brislife.com.au .. looks promising. They're also on Twitter: @brislife.	2009-11-13 22:08:23
25723	5700421554	How cool! RT @appiphany: Nasa has developed a chemical sensor accessory [for the] iPhone: http://bit.ly/1qR3vj	2009-11-13 21:48:53
25723	5700399906	@appiphany Wow. That's so cool!	2009-11-13 21:47:53
25723	5700374888	@IDEALAW That's ridiculous. Do they want to sell a car, or not?!	2009-11-13 21:46:42
25723	5700360462	@anna_samara There are people who have never had a kebab??!	2009-11-13 21:46:01
25723	5700017727	Nope. A reboot didn't fix it. No wifi on my laptop. *plugs in cable* Annoying.	2009-11-13 21:30:34
25723	5699983665	Today's best spam: Make your wiener an 'optimist'. O_o	2009-11-13 21:29:04
25723	5699796143	@AmandaJones68 Thanks. I'm happy it already seems to be on the mend. :-)	2009-11-13 21:20:45
25723	5699716737	@definatalie Hm. Interesting. How did I not know such a product existed? Cool. Thanks for the link. :-)	2009-11-13 21:17:06
25723	5699667302	@AmandaJones68 Well, I'm gulping down Ural. We'll see if that helps. I've been weeing less since this morning, so maybe it's helping.	2009-11-13 21:14:53
25723	5699630684	The wifi on my laptop seems to have carked it. Time for a reboot, perhaps.	2009-11-13 21:13:13
25723	5699477369	It amazes me sometimes, what a small place is Brisbane.	2009-11-13 21:06:22
25723	5699431592	@definatalie Dry shampooing? You mean like with talcum powder or something?	2009-11-13 21:04:23
25723	5699298084	@TrishwaH @AmandaJones68 I'm pretty sure it's the UTI causing it.	2009-11-13 20:58:36
25723	5699282090	@definatalie Aren't they just the best colours?! Such a shame they don't last longer.	2009-11-13 20:57:51
25723	5699270840	I just Googled & found (at a glance) at least 2 mentions of hives being caused by a UTI. So my suspicions may be correct.	2009-11-13 20:57:20
25723	5698957661	An occasional new itchy welt is popping up. Whatever my body is trying to expel, it's obviously not quite gone yet. #hives	2009-11-13 20:43:08
25723	5698881321	@sleepydumpling Pictures?	2009-11-13 20:39:44
25723	5698865043	@definatalie Awesome!! You're aware it fades quite quickly, though, right?	2009-11-13 20:38:59
25723	5698808752	@TrishwaH It's not so bad here. I have the insulation of a unit above mine.	2009-11-13 20:36:27
25723	5698790504	@kissability Oh, my .. O_o	2009-11-13 20:35:37
25723	5698718727	@BillHarper Also, just noticed: practising, not practicing. :-P	2009-11-13 20:32:23
25723	5698689606	@joshgeeksix Not to mention the horrible possibility of accidentally dropping your device into the bath. :-P	2009-11-13 20:31:06
25723	5698648614	@kissability What the?! Just .. what?	2009-11-13 20:29:18
25723	5698617696	Please, @mashable, make a mobile-friendly version of your website! And no, the @mashable iPhone app doesn't cut it.	2009-11-13 20:27:54
25723	5698469449	@calrion What was going on, @badmummy?	2009-11-13 20:21:11
25723	5698454530	@calrion Threading works with DMs in some apps. @sendai sees threaded DMs on his Mac.	2009-11-13 20:20:31
25723	5698420918	@BluntNate Sounds like Brisbane public transport lately. The trains have had major troubles for about a week.	2009-11-13 20:19:00
25723	5698388182	@djackmanson Hah!! Love it! :-D	2009-11-13 20:17:29
25723	5698368114	@theladyisugly We call that a spider.	2009-11-13 20:16:32
25723	5698359277	@veganza The kid bit down with his gums once while breastfeeding. Latched on like a pitbull. Oh, man. The scream that escaped my lips. O_o	2009-11-13 20:16:08
25723	5698296411	@BillHarper Seriously? O_o That's just embarrassing. :-/ @brisneyland	2009-11-13 20:13:20
25723	5697283286	@IDEALAW Um, same as what? There's no 'in reply to' .. ?	2009-11-13 19:24:14
25723	5697267310	@sendai More efficient than hybrids?	2009-11-13 19:23:22
25723	5697207600	@chendo Will they force you to clap & woo?	2009-11-13 19:20:04
25723	5697155536	@djackmanson .. worked at a call centre again, I mean.	2009-11-13 19:17:06
25723	5697150065	@djackmanson *nods* I've been there. I would turn to prostitution before I worked at a call centre.	2009-11-13 19:16:48
25723	5697124220	@badmummy Sounds good to me. Let's get it into common use. :-D	2009-11-13 19:15:23
25723	5697105982	@IDEALAW They either started _really_ young, or they have good genes.	2009-11-13 19:14:27
25723	5697061344	@calrion @djackmanson I actually find it quite funny. But then, I _am_ rather easily amused. *grin*	2009-11-13 19:12:11
25723	5697024612	@djackmanson GSOL! You, sir, are very amusing. Heh. :-)	2009-11-13 19:10:27
25723	5697003249	@macsnorky Inderstand?? As well as not _understanding_ it, I obviously also can't type. *sigh*	2009-11-13 19:09:28
25723	5696986832	@macsnorky So I _still_ don't indertand that article. Hah! :-D	2009-11-13 19:08:42
25723	5696975348	@macsnorky ROTFL! :-D	2009-11-13 19:08:11
25723	5696964939	@djackmanson Indeed. People are greedy & stupid.	2009-11-13 19:07:43
25723	5696757107	@macsnorky Um. Possibly. I was talking about the bamboo/dolphins die article.	2009-11-13 18:59:02
25723	5696747344	@chendo *chuckles*	2009-11-13 18:58:37
25723	5696579966	@kissability Um. Wow.	2009-11-13 18:51:32
25723	5696497870	@chendo @sendai Oh, my goodness. You two are _such_ nerds. LOL! :-D	2009-11-13 18:48:06
25723	5696437130	@sendai Wow. It's really pretty there. :-)	2009-11-13 18:45:33
25723	5696381513	@kissability Oh, man. Bugger. :-/	2009-11-13 18:43:15
25723	5696373584	@chendo I wonder if they get special pay for being forced to do that crap. :-/	2009-11-13 18:42:55
25723	5696303396	@kissability ROTFL! That would have been hilarious! :-D	2009-11-13 18:40:06
25723	5696174977	.@brisneyland I wonder if those poor Apple store employees were given extra pay for that crap. Or maybe drugs to make them act that way.	2009-11-13 18:34:46
25723	5696116368	@kindredwolf WTF is wrong with people? O_o	2009-11-13 18:32:24
25723	5696085114	@brisneyland I would so just look surly & refuse to high five anyone. I can't stand high fives at the best of times. :-/	2009-11-13 18:31:09
25723	5696064230	@kindredwolf They stalked you via a music/radio site?	2009-11-13 18:30:20
25723	5696053348	@macsnorky Okay. I think my brain really has shut down. Now you've _completely_ lost me. O_o	2009-11-13 18:29:57
25723	5696017581	@brisneyland Yah. Exactly one of the reasons I didn't want to go. Bleah. :-/	2009-11-13 18:28:27
25723	5695891597	@kindredwolf Enough time for what to have happened?	2009-11-13 18:23:18
25723	5695877667	Hives update: thighs looking slightly less red & welty. Still a bit itchy on lower legs & various spots, but 1% of the craziness of 2 am.	2009-11-13 18:22:45
25723	5695825938	@sendai Why is diesel better?	2009-11-13 18:20:41
25723	5695785369	@macsnorky Wha? That's a joke, right? Or I'm missing something. I know I'm dopey lately, but I don't get it.	2009-11-13 18:19:01
25723	5695280754	@Alybean There's nothing they can do except tell me to take an antihistamine. It's not spreading, so I'm going to leave it.	2009-11-13 17:59:12
25723	5695117407	@theladyisugly Okay. *waits for it to appear*	2009-11-13 17:52:38
25723	5695048634	@Alybean Which tripod thing? On the wall of the building? I see a candy cane on each side, plus what might be a lettebox on the right.	2009-11-13 17:49:53
25723	5694973839	@danielbowen Oh, geez! Of all people to share your name. *shudders*	2009-11-13 17:46:51
25723	5694840592	@Alybean *chuckles* Trust me, I'm pretty sure it's not a good look. LOL! :-D	2009-11-13 17:41:28
25723	5694510218	@Alybean There's no 'in reply to'. A tease about what?	2009-11-13 17:28:04
25723	5694382097	Sitting around the house in the most inelegant way possible for a short skirt to try to keep cool air at the hives on my inner thighs. :-P	2009-11-13 17:22:53
25723	5694209671	The look of hives is amusing. Kind of like some fast-spreading, non-gross-looking, flesh-eating disease. The feel of it is less amusing.	2009-11-13 17:15:48
25723	5694138839	@CyberWasteland Sadly, I think you're right.	2009-11-13 17:12:55
25723	5694122198	@theladyisugly How/when/what situation were you allowed to choose your own names?	2009-11-13 17:12:13
25723	5693839836	The scritchiness of the salt in the Nana May's scrub feels _so_ good on the hives. Ahhhhhhh. *blissful smiles*	2009-11-13 17:01:06
25723	5693785137	That was supposed to read it _may_ still be spreading. #hives	2009-11-13 16:59:05
25723	5693772827	Okay. It still be spreading. Time for another Nana May's treatment & a cold shower. Hives suck. :-(	2009-11-13 16:58:34
25723	5693723671	@chrisblake What is cream of wheat? Is it a breakfast cereal or something?	2009-11-13 16:56:36
25723	5693657482	Finding various semi-isolated itchy welts down my legs which may or may not be the hives still spreading. *tries to stop scratching*	2009-11-13 16:54:01
25723	5693499609	@joshgeeksix Yup! I guessed the fountain (it's really good!), but I wasn't sure what _type_ the shop was. Heh.	2009-11-13 16:47:43
25723	5693326997	@PortaPocketGal Not so good. I was up with hives for 2 hours last night & it's still itchy like crazy. No rush on the PPs. :-)	2009-11-13 16:40:51
25723	5693232488	The kid (6 y/o) drew these just now. A fountain & a Christmas shop, he tells me. I love his drawings. :-) http://twitpic.com/pegzy	2009-11-13 16:37:06
25723	5692990475	I just put my glass of cold Ural against the worst of the hives on my inner thighs. Ohhhhhhh, the relief!	2009-11-13 16:27:33
25723	5692929176	@macsnorky I'm hoping it does. This one (supposedly) has cranberry in it, which is supposed to be good for it. Want to avoid antibiotics.	2009-11-13 16:25:07
25723	5692888445	@calrion Well, yeah, that too. :-P	2009-11-13 16:23:30
25723	5692776423	Now guzzling Ural for a suspected UTI. Nice to have that on top of the hives. I wonder if they could be related?	2009-11-13 16:19:06
25723	5692751556	@sampagan No need. Treatment is just taking an antihistamine, but it's stopped spreading & I've used a topical treatment already for it.	2009-11-13 16:18:07
25723	5692282169	@onefinebreeder LOL! :-D	2009-11-13 16:00:06
25723	5692260440	Really annoyed at the misspelled #youknowyouruglyif hashtag on Twitter. Grr. >:-(	2009-11-13 15:59:15
25723	5692128876	@sleepydumpling It must have been a reaction to something. Dead certain it's nothing in my bedding.	2009-11-13 15:54:03
25723	5692096582	@Alybean Nope. No market today, thank goodness.	2009-11-13 15:52:47
25723	5691640059	@theladyisugly _If_ an insect started it, no, he wasn't bitten, thankfully.	2009-11-13 15:34:52
25723	5691627225	@theladyisugly It wasn't an insect that did all that. I had some reaction to something. Well, maybe it was one bite & the hives began.	2009-11-13 15:34:23
25723	5691570061	@sleepydumpling They all joined up on my thighs during the night: http://twitpic.com/pe590	2009-11-13 15:32:12
25723	5691546368	@PortaPocketGal Thanks for the #ff. :-)	2009-11-13 15:31:19
25723	5691538425	@theladyisugly Thanks for the #ff. :-)	2009-11-13 15:31:01
25723	5691517491	The kid's now pointing out all the itchy hive welts on my back, too. Hives suck. *pouts*	2009-11-13 15:30:16
25723	5691473802	@theladyisugly The kid's now pointing out all the little itchy welts on my back, too.	2009-11-13 15:28:40
25723	5691414488	@Alybean He was fine, thankfully. He didn't get hit with whatever I did. He stayed asleep the while time.	2009-11-13 15:26:31
25723	5691377747	The hives on my thigh this morning. Not as itchy as last night, but I'll do more Nana May's. http://twitpic.com/pe590	2009-11-13 15:25:09
25723	5685547084	@Alybean Not that I know of. It was just some random reaction from .. I dunno .. something!	2009-11-13 11:37:49
25723	5685271422	Okay. I think I'm going to try to get back to sleep. I'm still a bit itchy, but the Nana May's helped a lot. #hives	2009-11-13 11:27:32
25723	5685172133	@onefinebreeder Ugh! That's terrible. How long did it last?	2009-11-13 11:23:51
25723	5685053430	@onefinebreeder What is PUPPS?	2009-11-13 11:19:23
25723	5684879813	@BluntNate Guh. Me, too. I woke with an attack of hives. Not happy. :-(	2009-11-13 11:12:52
25723	5684809046	@onefinebreeder I don't have any. I used some of the salt & oil scrub I sell (it's got lots of mint oil in it) & a cold shower. It's helped.	2009-11-13 11:10:15
25723	5684640881	@onefinebreeder This: http://twitpic.com/pcy0x	2009-11-13 11:04:03

25723	5684367596	@phdinparenting What an awesome picture.	2009-11-13 10:54:05
25723	5684271998	@AmandaJones68 Thanks. I hope you get some sleep. *hugs*	2009-11-13 10:50:31
25723	5684253108	@theladyisugly Don't think so. If that was it, would have happened hours ago while I was still awake, I'd think.	2009-11-13 10:49:48
25723	5684226575	@AmandaJones68 Already did that to wash off the salt in the Nana May's. Both things helped a lot.	2009-11-13 10:48:46
25723	5684200768	@AmandaJones68 Maybe it's the mint in it. Nana May's has lots of peppermint & spearmint.	2009-11-13 10:47:48
25723	5684084603	Geez. Even my damn ears are itchy. Not happy, Jan. Damn hives. *pouts* :-(	2009-11-13 10:43:28
25723	5684017010	@ZucchiniBikini Oh, my goodness. I used to _hate_ it when Smiley did that. *slump* I hope you got some sleep. *hugs*	2009-11-13 10:40:58
25723	5683872515	@AmandaJones68 And why are you awake at this hour?	2009-11-13 10:35:35
25723	5683866693	@Kblogger I don't understand why I've been hit with hives all of a sudden! *pouts* This sucks. :-(	2009-11-13 10:35:22
25723	5683841372	@theladyisugly I've used some Nana May's Magic Hands (the stuff I sell), which has helped a lot, & seemed to stop it spreading. *scratches*	2009-11-13 10:34:27
25723	5683808894	@theladyisugly Yeah. It's now after 2.30 am. :-(	2009-11-13 10:33:14
25723	5683752925	Thank goodness for Nana May's, I tell you. I'm still a bit itchy, but it's made a huge difference. Why hives at this hour?! Arrgh!	2009-11-13 10:31:11
25723	5683726823	Thanks, all. I have no idea what happened! I just woke scratching my wrist & suddenly I was itchy all over the place! *resists scratching*	2009-11-13 10:30:15
25723	5683637613	@SassyCyndi Bet it was nice to have her back. Heh. :-)	2009-11-13 10:26:58
25723	5683626522	@AmandaJones68 Nope. Only Sunday, this weekend.	2009-11-13 10:26:32
25723	5683613213	That pic I posted is the worst patch of the hives. I just got up & used Nana May's all over me. It's helped a bit with the itchiness.	2009-11-13 10:26:04

47203	5498521140	The urge to open the dishwasher to see what's going on inside is strong. Leave it alone bel, leave it alone	2009-11-06 22:09:08

47203	5187538302	The devil is in my car  http://twitpic.com/n33hc	2009-10-26 19:16:35
47203	5187020085	@EvilSue still dunno. The real estate agent is trying every trick in the book to push the offer up and the owners are umming and ahhing	2009-10-26 18:56:38
47203	5186557100	Okay so this morning I've woken up with another mouth ulcer. That's two, both on the inside of my lower lip. I can't even smile. Gah!	2009-10-26 18:38:34

47203	5174160915	@antzpantz she didn't check if John cleaned the bathrooms properly	2009-10-26 09:38:09

50263	6168127147	I just generated my #TweetCloud out of a year of my tweets. Top three words: people, time, home - http://w33.us/heh	2009-11-29 05:51:49
50263	6168096733	@jkazantzis Are you sure Desert Island Discs goes on iplayer? I've a feeling it doesn't because of the records which are copyright	2009-11-29 05:49:42
50263	6156165260	I seem to be going down with a mutant species-hopping variant of man-flu :-( #fb	2009-11-28 18:57:36
50263	6153638563	@jessicaduchen For me, carless, the saving of £££s is the killer fact that also allows me to take moral high ground ;-)	2009-11-28 17:09:35
50263	6153620085	However, 'The Real Monarch' although silly, added another layer to the argument that the Monarchical system is illegitimate and unfounded	2009-11-28 17:08:44
50263	6153590335	And Queen Victoria became Queen in 1837 not 1839. These are facts that should not even need researching	2009-11-28 17:07:23
50263	6153576496	if you're going to present a history programme get some basic facts right - pregnancy is measured as 40 weeks from LMP not from conception.	2009-11-28 17:06:46
50263	6152066604	Does it really take 8 police officers to levy an £80 fine in a pub which no underage drinker would risk their street cred by frequenting?	2009-11-28 15:59:20
50263	6152029086	The police are now a laughing stock of the entire community of that pub: where's the police advice against armed robbers?	2009-11-28 15:57:37
50263	6152001238	I don't disagree with clamping down on underage drinking, but setting a honeytrap in an old man's pub where there isn't a problem?	2009-11-28 15:56:21
50263	6151983497	Fortunately the lads went outside, or else he'd have been facing a £100o smoking fine, too, as they distracted him from running orderly pub	2009-11-28 15:55:32
50263	6151962334	And as he was being distracted by being interviewed by 8 police officers, two lads decided to smoke in the corridor	2009-11-28 15:54:36
50263	6151948706	Meanwhile, they treated him like a criminal for having ID in his official name (James is his middle name, like Gordon is for the PM)	2009-11-28 15:53:59
50263	6151912990	Their reply was, of course, sod all. Nothing like creating a non-existent crime or risk-based intelligence-based policing	2009-11-28 15:52:21
50263	6151877292	Everyone else in pub was >40; he did ask the 8 police officers who collared him what they doing about 6 local armed robberies on pubs etc	2009-11-28 15:50:44
50263	6151859049	Jimmy's not happy after being handed an £80 fine by police last night - for serving two underage, undercover police agents.	2009-11-28 15:49:56
50263	6151690122	You know, you'd think reading the Daily Mail & that, that these right wingers were actually in favour of domestic violence....Oh	2009-11-28 15:42:23
50263	6151665289	Is it dead embarrassing to admit I don't have a recording of Guerrelieder?	2009-11-28 15:41:19
50263	6151421360	@LadyofMisrule Absolutely not. I would rather my eyes be gouged out with a red hot poker.	2009-11-28 15:30:36
50263	6151312126	@tommypearson It's out early to pave the way for the Xmas Double Edition. You never noticed before how that happens?	2009-11-28 15:26:01

50263	6151181876	@wigmore_hall If you don't mind me saying so, it's a bit lame tweeting at 18:36 a concert that will begin at 19:30. Hardly travelling time!	2009-11-28 15:20:27
50263	6151110475	@DBTheTruth Don't stand for the racist abuse; on the other hand, imagine what a sad loser the abuser must be. Feel pity, not anger.	2009-11-28 15:17:23
50263	6151030128	I can hear my neighbours' music. Too loud for comfort but not reasonably approaching nuisance. Nevertheless, it needs rebuttal. Suggestions?	2009-11-28 15:13:55

60663	5928757065	@AndyParkinson And IMO not while it's a standalone service. It would make more sense to "convert" a normal email into a Wave.	2009-11-21 15:35:05

60663	5903030722	@webwright I predict Twitter will go the way of AOL. Email became federated, microblogging will, too.	2009-11-20 16:54:55
60663	5903002378	@webwright Facebook is still not profitable and may never be. Twitter's problem, to me, is that Twitter itself cannot remain the platform.	2009-11-20 16:53:45
60663	5902689461	@anwith1n But I can see that in People... I don't have to buy Playgirl.	2009-11-20 16:40:55
60663	5902672863	Oh no I'm being followed by stock-related Twitter accounts now. GO AWAY.	2009-11-20 16:40:16
60663	5902634461	@yaauie I believe you can currently buy access to varying levels of the stream, too, which a few companies are doing.	2009-11-20 16:38:40
60663	5902618626	@yaauie It's making something from the search deal with Google and Microsoft. And it had ads in Japan at one point.	2009-11-20 16:38:01
60663	5902605039	@webwright I want so badly to believe that people have learned NOT to buy stock in non-revenue-generating companies, but they still will.	2009-11-20 16:37:27
60663	5902576415	@webwright Which means even if it had a successful IPO launch its stock would eventually be worth almost nothing.	2009-11-20 16:36:16
60663	5902548186	@webwright I'd agree with the small chance of acquisiton or IPO but not in actually generating revenue.	2009-11-20 16:35:09

60663	5902200734	@webwright Perhaps a little Wingdings ghost character in lieu of $.	2009-11-20 16:21:08
60663	5902176832	@webwright Twitter will never, ever be worth $1bil and they know it. So maybe they need a different sign than $ to represent valuation.	2009-11-20 16:20:11
60663	5902155619	@webwright Isn't it wrong for everyone to know that the numbers don't actually mean anything? Does that have far-reaching implications?	2009-11-20 16:19:18
60663	5901492621	@webwright But that means the numbers aren't real, and everyone knows it, so it is new math, yes?	2009-11-20 15:52:01

60663	5897403002	@ChrisKubica Not to mention, driving straight across the country, extending each gas stop by a little bit can mean 1 less stop altogether!	2009-11-20 13:02:34
60663	5897391668	@ChrisKubica Not really... driving cross-country it's easy to calculate your mpg, so I had a pretty good idea of how far 1gal would get me.	2009-11-20 13:02:07
60663	5897305289	@ChrisKubica I used to drive cross-country a lot, so I'd play a "one more exit!" game with myself. I'm a serial boundary-tester.	2009-11-20 12:58:46

60663	5897215579	Or I could get an Atlas tramp stamp. Heh.	2009-11-20 12:55:03
60663	5897204172	I'm open to a "Who Is John Galt?" tattoo, too, but that seems even harder to fit somewhere.	2009-11-20 12:54:34
60663	5897192353	@rustyspeidel It's from Atlas Shrugged. Essentially, a fact is a fact, whether or not we like it.	2009-11-20 12:54:05
60663	5897151031	@ChrisKubica I have tested and tested (and tested) how far it'll go with the E light on, and I never once ran out of gas.	2009-11-20 12:52:22
60663	5897138478	@ChrisKubica She brought it up, I didn't ask. Filling that awkward silence during the test drive, I guess. It was good to know!	2009-11-20 12:51:51

304713	5867312233	@pfanderson We instil the less web savvy with "Don't click anything that you can't verify!" Using TinyURL goes against this...	2009-11-19 14:09:40

638323	5876669125	Getting super pumped about tonight's @github meetup. Gonna be epic!	2009-11-19 20:05:26
638323	5876006270	@mattly Epicenter (4th & Harrison) fits that bill pretty well.	2009-11-19 19:40:11
638323	5870012102	@Heilemann Doesn't seem to exist? Is that a windows only thing? :(  http://twitpic.com/q5c15	2009-11-19 15:53:18
638323	5869508568	@crisdobbins If you're here tonight, hit up Zeitgeist @ 9pm. GitHub drinkup!	2009-11-19 15:34:08
638323	5869494991	@bleikamp @groovemonkey I can't even begin to explain in 140 chars.  Double parked cars, people dancing in the street, parrots and cops	2009-11-19 15:33:37
638323	5869195218	What the fuck just happened? This city is crazy.	2009-11-19 15:22:18
638323	5867927924	Bored at @rubyconf ?  Check out how GitHub handles asset bundling and serving: http://bit.ly/1T1D2I	2009-11-19 14:33:40
638323	5866462898	@zachinglis Nah, feel pretty good actually. (Tho I was kinda hammered last night). Just need caffeeeeeeeiiiine	2009-11-19 13:36:28
638323	5866315210	Zombie Kyle needs caffeine	2009-11-19 13:30:43
638323	5847336585	@bleikamp It's insane. It's not even in San Francisco. Everyone is floored.	2009-11-18 21:26:12
638323	5846829538	@snookca Wow, they seriously planned that on the first day of RubyConf? That's insane. Almost as insane as the venue for RubyConf.	2009-11-18 21:05:58
638323	5846558244	Sorry for trying to use your site Tumblr, I won't do it again.  http://twitpic.com/q26u2	2009-11-18 20:55:44
638323	5846173309	@tekkub So my md looks like: https://gist.github.com/64c0088c956519cabcf2	2009-11-18 20:40:47
638323	5846138614	@tekkub That's why I hacked markdown for my blog http://warpspire.com/tipsresources/programming/hacking-markdown-classes-on-the-element/	2009-11-18 20:39:31
638323	5845971829	Today is clearly the day where everything that worked yesterday stops working without you changing it	2009-11-18 20:33:15
638323	5841463664	I suddenly realize how many out of town people I've added to foursquare now that their checkins are pouring into my phone as they get to SFO	2009-11-18 17:45:46
638323	5840128358	@mattly This is what the weather was like yesterday when I walked downtown.  A few hours later I was walking in the rain. Who knows.	2009-11-18 16:56:33
638323	5836375142	Shame their coffee is shit, because otherwise I really like Oakside cafe.  Awesome little upstairs w/ free wifi. And!! http://bit.ly/228Svt	2009-11-18 14:33:01
638323	5835810712	@bobmortland Let's do this shit. We can find our old high school IDs and pick up some sweet underage chicks.	2009-11-18 14:09:57
638323	5820121982	Snow Patrol is exactly the type of music I should loathe.    Why can't I stop listening?	2009-11-18 00:38:09
638323	5820054122	@Earbasher My mom used to watch so much Law & Order that I get a feeling of despair flush over me every time I hear the DUN DUN intro music	2009-11-18 00:33:32
638323	5819445020	This is all we have... http://bit.ly/17VWad	2009-11-17 23:55:39
638323	5815201864	Mmmm... Muni + wet smelly people. Nothing else quite like it in the world.   I need to get a bike so bad.	2009-11-17 20:40:52
638323	5813567141	@mattly honestly, it was gorgeous when I walked to the cafe. 3 hours later, rainy, windy and freezing. I blame you PNWers too.	2009-11-17 19:38:20
638323	5809234018	@danthebeast I have (one of the best in SF) coffee kiosks 1.5 blocks from my house. One of the better things to ever happen in my life.	2009-11-17 16:59:12
638323	5809089325	@mattly It must be. Power outlets are 50% of why I love the train (with the other 50% being that there is no TSA)	2009-11-17 16:53:44
638323	5808778946	@mattly You are insane. There are plugs all over every amtrak train.	2009-11-17 16:42:06
638323	5805482357	I won't let you bury it. I won' let you smother it. I won't let you murder it.	2009-11-17 14:34:09
638323	5804903099	@foodgoesinmouth 2-3 days usually	2009-11-17 14:10:21
638323	5804238134	@mattly I use one called Remote Jr. that lets you do that. Even use trackpad.	2009-11-17 13:42:08
638323	5804227507	Got my 2nd laptop reformatted & ready as a backup. Two things: matte screens &gt;&gt; glossy and new MBP trackpad is so much better than the old.	2009-11-17 13:41:40
638323	5802890600	@technoweenie Seriously. I just got Assassins' Creed II for $15 shipped. Amazon is throwing credits at me left and right.	2009-11-17 12:44:28
638323	5790356842	Anyone going somewhere to see the meteors tonight?	2009-11-17 01:37:48
638323	5789599315	My feeble fingers and wrists do not agree with this much drumming. 1 hour seems to be my limit for now :(	2009-11-17 00:43:49
638323	5789586898	@eston Yeah... on the plus side, I've been coming here for a week and haven't been stabbed yet. Down side: I'm serious.	2009-11-17 00:42:59
638323	5789386554	@eston 6th and Jessie	2009-11-17 00:30:01
638323	5789343058	Drenched in sweat. Surrounded by noise. Just me, my drums and a dozen bands in a warehouse. Couldn't be happier. 	2009-11-17 00:27:08
638323	5788300449	@derekpunsalan what you in sf for?  Rubyconf?	2009-11-16 23:25:57
638323	5786344373	@gbissett Fair enough. It's because you're using more than you have allocated. I'll see if I can make it clearer.	2009-11-16 21:53:02
638323	5785200981	Overcaffeinated Kyle is overcaffeinated. But productive. Currently cooking dinner + doing laundry + MW2 + debugging app. Must. Calm. Down.	2009-11-16 21:06:28
638323	5783287041	@flangy It's a placeholder that will make more sense with future features. Don't worry, it's not frivolous.	2009-11-16 19:52:45
638323	5780290985	@luxuryluke You're just saying that to make me feel better. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ALRIGHT. EVERYTHING IS IN CHAOS. MADNESS PREVAILS.	2009-11-16 18:00:03
638323	5779650348	@eston @teekub also, it's definitely a twitter issue http://is.gd/4WE2O They just don't care about 3rd party apps	2009-11-16 17:35:29
638323	5779595405	@eston @tekkub I'm using Tweetie :/	2009-11-16 17:33:23
638323	5779477745	I am seriously losing my shit over these empty avatars. @eston @defunkt @fabienpenso @zachinglis re-upload your avatars!	2009-11-16 17:29:00
638323	5779329161	@defunkt Fuck, that video is so amazing.	2009-11-16 17:23:21
638323	5776585534	@dotnetted Yep, with any of the hardware specific stuff being handled by Rackspace.	2009-11-16 15:39:32
638323	5776549007	@slopod Because you work at an agency. OH SNAP.	2009-11-16 15:38:05
638323	5775694167	@dotnetted On the list...  Everyone that @github is following is an employee - http://twitter.com/github	2009-11-16 15:04:44
638323	5775197239	@technoweenie What is this nonsense? That's absurd.	2009-11-16 14:45:04
638323	5774959866	Gonna be an epic @github meetup this week. http://is.gd/4WxAY  If you don't come, I'm so unfollowing you. You've been warned.	2009-11-16 14:35:27
638323	5772767684	@gilesgoatboy @mattly It's mostly a fail of IA, all their sites are scattered. Not so much a purposeful misdirection.	2009-11-16 13:05:08
638323	5772744488	@gilesgoatboy @mattly FWIW, They do have a whole site explaining it http://280atlas.com as well as an intro post http://280.posterous.com	2009-11-16 13:04:10
638323	5772524739	I'm having a really hard time distinguishing between friedisms and real quotes. http://is.gd/4Wt62 http://is.gd/4Wt6V	2009-11-16 12:55:11
638323	5759441181	Why yes I am going through Stick Control at 11pm. Who doesn't find the sound of 16ths at 120bpm for an hour soothing? Wonder why I'm single.	2009-11-16 01:13:24
638323	5753903922	@bleikamp @jotto develop.github.com is pretty complete. What do you think is missing?	2009-11-15 20:32:06
638323	5752104015	@kr15t3a drumming won out on this round. Most likely MW2 later tonight though.	2009-11-15 19:20:22
638323	5750613153	@godfoca @Scryypy Bah, real drums!	2009-11-15 18:21:55
638323	5750485515	@VoodooIdol Dubious. Computers tend to break when I use them as drum sticks.	2009-11-15 18:16:57
638323	5750037613	Hmm. Write, drum, code, or game?	2009-11-15 17:59:41
638323	5749269352	After all these years, my parents (well, some of them) still can't wrap their heads around the idea that I don't have a "10 year plan"	2009-11-15 17:29:11
638323	5749174093	@orderedlist The "sandwich" shop or the transportation method?	2009-11-15 17:25:20
638323	5749015716	@tekkub You can uncheck songs on the iPod (in iTunes) too.	2009-11-15 17:18:52
638323	5729002454	@zachinglis No idea.	2009-11-14 23:11:27
638323	5727980189	I want to start an emo power-violence band. Best genre name ever.	2009-11-14 22:22:54
638323	5727499640	@atmos @godfoca You guys going for drinks tonight?	2009-11-14 22:00:11
638323	5704350436	It's rare you can hear baby making music & baby killing music in the same night. What a fucking ridiculous awesome show. My life is complete	2009-11-14 01:35:43
638323	5703657800	Holy fucking Glass Jaw sir	2009-11-14 00:45:12
638323	5701742788	@godfoca definitely!	2009-11-13 22:52:38
638323	5699803314	Things that are good to know  http://yfrog.com/5anufrj	2009-11-13 21:21:04
638323	5697331531	@cmelbye Thanks, should be fixed now.	2009-11-13 19:26:52
638323	5696983569	Today has been a pretty fuckin' awesome week for music & me. Can't wait for RX Bandits + Glass Jaw tonight.	2009-11-13 19:08:33
638323	5695606658	Then I must regress, I feel I've made myself perfectly redundant.	2009-11-13 18:11:48
638323	5688894225	OH: "I'm happy to manage devs and get into debates about methodology and coding practices, but I'm not a good practitioner—I can't code"	2009-11-13 13:47:16
638323	5688544979	Twitter search 'github' is my new QA team.	2009-11-13 13:33:05
638323	5676341133	Coming home to a new always sunny? Possibly the best feeling in the universe.	2009-11-13 04:30:12

638323	5667331018	@VoodooIdol Ha! Like you would care Miss Hater.  Teenage Bottlerocket.	2009-11-12 19:57:20
638323	5667007890	@VoodooIdol Big words coming from a little girl. I'm headed to Bottom of the Hill for a show.  Not sure when it'll be done.	2009-11-12 19:45:00
638323	5666388089	@Earbasher Don't worry, it's a man's drink.	2009-11-12 19:21:28
638323	5666215368	@Earbasher That's an Old fashioned, son!  I played with it in mill color a bit, so the color got a little more red :)	2009-11-12 19:14:49
638323	5665964060	This is how I deal with IE7 testing http://flic.kr/p/7fgKub	2009-11-12 19:05:19
638323	5665438047	@cduruk Not a lot. But in fairness, until recently many major portions of the site were non-functional in IE7 & below.	2009-11-12 18:45:55
638323	5665175087	Damn, we're almost going to be fully supporting IE7 soon. That's a victory... ?	2009-11-12 18:35:58
638323	5661934224	So with closure compiler, how do I silence warnings? warning_level, logging_level, summary_detail_level? None seem to have any effect.	2009-11-12 16:35:16
638323	5660631014	MW2 is sitting here staring me down daring me to put it in. But I've got to get some shit done before some \m/ at Bottom of the Hill tonight	2009-11-12 15:45:14
638323	5628087024	@t0fu so frustrating. I JUST smogged it in July. I hate that a sticker on a part that releases clean air makes me fail an emissions test	2009-11-11 14:14:42
638323	5627571529	In other words: love you too, California.	2009-11-11 13:53:00
638323	5627558358	Found a buyer for my car! Unfortunately need to change blow off valve to re-pass smog since the carb # reqirements have changed since July.	2009-11-11 13:52:23
638323	5624411045	@Rockers_Delight jealous! Have a good time, I love me some Eddie izzard.	2009-11-11 11:35:33
638323	5613114339	Apparantly tomorrow us veterans day. And parents will be grilling steaks. Nice timing.	2009-11-11 01:25:46
638323	5608933828	I have lost almost all my footwork, but damn playing my kit feels good.  Happy to be eliminating excuses from my life this week.	2009-11-10 21:30:51
638323	5605861883	@luckiestmonkey Ack! I may have to bail on you.  RX Bandits > Pomplamoose	2009-11-10 19:22:51
638323	5605549636	I have no idea why GlassJaw is playing with RX Bandits, but stoked to be seeing them this Friday @ The Regency	2009-11-10 19:09:58

638323	5599624120	@benschwarz Yeah, we used to, had to disable temporarily. Will be back soon. http://github.com/defunkt/resque/graphs/clones	2009-11-10 15:18:44
638323	5599390401	@josephruscio What makes you think we don't dude? :)	2009-11-10 15:09:20
638323	5598770090	The good (?) thing about using your product to develop your product is that you notice site outages probably more than anyone else.	2009-11-10 14:44:16
638323	5598021267	@danthebeast Holy shit those are awesome. I think I just accidentally bought some of those.	2009-11-10 14:13:43

638323	5582298439	@bleything No, it's bi-larious!	2009-11-10 00:18:51
638323	5580759246	@Stammy Hah, it's kind of true. The other side of the story is that if CEL is solid-on, it doesn't mean anything.	2009-11-09 22:55:56
638323	5575782520	@benschwarz My worst habit is saying "catch you later" to people I have NO intention of ever seeing again. Fucking California lingo at work.	2009-11-09 19:28:21
638323	5575332940	@Earbasher Never!	2009-11-09 19:10:59

638323	5568550061	@natech It's more the 800px high ads that kick in 30s after pageload (just enough time for you to start reading) and throw the content down	2009-11-09 14:51:07
638323	5567482124	@jeremyboles Rockin dude, love it.  Coincidentally I was wondering if the new Mae was worth buying :)  You gonna put the code up anywhere?	2009-11-09 14:05:26
638323	5567391589	@qrush Hah. I kind of wanted to randomize it, but I felt like it would just feel like I was ripping off flickr ;)	2009-11-09 14:01:40

678323	5946257809	@ebertchicago The first question might well be how many young people know who he was.	2009-11-22 08:06:25

678323	5933841486	@bpende I knew we were in trouble when I saw Hallowe'en candy in August. People are wishing their lives away. Bah, humbug to pre-T-day noels	2009-11-21 19:29:05
678323	5933473673	@gloriabell Well done!	2009-11-21 19:12:38
678323	5932083389	@anniemal [NOW you're onto something....  ]	2009-11-21 18:10:29
678323	5931782186	@anniemal I agree with @lwcavallucci. Not everyone would be there. You are their strength now, whether you believe it or not. Good job.	2009-11-21 17:56:43
678323	5931616963	@threefromleith oh you British birdwatchers and your wonderful bird names. were they Great or Blue ones, Grant?	2009-11-21 17:49:05
678323	5931228990	@threefromleith you were planning that tweet all along, weren't you?	2009-11-21 17:31:09
678323	5931094638	@threefromleith No big deal - you obviously know the barred/spotted call!	2009-11-21 17:25:05
678323	5930194459	@threefromleith so it IS the new way to chat! more power to them.	2009-11-21 16:43:33
678323	5930139170	@baratunde Thank you for the NewMoon tweets, which were great fun beside @Ewan's Junior Eurovision twitterings. Ah, culture!	2009-11-21 16:40:56
678323	5930107938	@threefromleith Wrong owl, Grant. Screech does a liquidy descending warbling call - like a horse's whinny, only softer. unmistakable	2009-11-21 16:39:29
678323	5929914372	@imnico yep. How's the investigation? Are the dogs OK?	2009-11-21 16:30:21
678323	5929883093	@attila hehe. Did I mention I was in Havertown, a couuple of blocks off Rte 3? Love hearing wildlife coping with urban sprawl.	2009-11-21 16:28:53
678323	5929775934	Screech owl whinnying so loudly in the backyard that I can hear it through the closed kitchen window. w00t!	2009-11-21 16:23:50
678323	5928738002	@Michske I think we're onto something here. Seeing the invective re:today's voting, though, I'd doubt we'd stay "united" afterwards.  @ewan	2009-11-21 15:34:11
678323	5928567693	@Michske @Ewan Don't forget the hula and the Alaskans!	2009-11-21 15:26:12
678323	5928524469	@Michske (hehe - saw your post after I sent mine - you've got the right idea about that! but if it were worldwide... ohhhh!)	2009-11-21 15:24:10
678323	5928506672	@Ewan @Michske Of course, the very first problem for a US version would be, "whaddya mean, I can't vote for my state? Screw that!"	2009-11-21 15:23:20
678323	5928430095	@Michske @ewan all that being said, if we did statewise voting here, it would be amazingly interesting, I think.	2009-11-21 15:19:48
678323	5928418366	@Michske I loved the kids. Yes, tricky, and I don't have the cultural history to be able to see the subtleness in song choice and voting.	2009-11-21 15:19:15
678323	5928394247	@Ewan Yes. @michske's right - it's the unabashed enthusiasm that wins the day. SO much better than the AmericanIdol crap we get here.	2009-11-21 15:18:07
678323	5928326452	@Ewan @Michske Loving the tapping sneakers. But I'm still going to be yodeling tomorrow.  Ralf is a young JonBonJovi, no?	2009-11-21 15:15:03
678323	5927877284	@Ewan man oh man...  I have to not think too hard about what they're saying, just give it some time to sink in, and then I understand, sorta	2009-11-21 14:54:20
678323	5927729925	@Ewan just amazing.	2009-11-21 14:47:30
678323	5927638688	I feel like I'm watching Cirque Lite http://bit.ly/8EOojY	2009-11-21 14:43:22
678323	5927449239	@amyhoy I completely agree re: Boxee logo. On nights when I fall asleep, only to wake up to that screensaver --  ewwwww!	2009-11-21 14:34:45
678323	5927276670	@Michske Ewan didn't give us second and third. I'd agree on the tapdancing trainers, but 3rd is a tossup	2009-11-21 14:26:53
678323	5927157699	@Michske I still think she deserves to win. Looked a little overwhelmed, but that's only natural. (she won in my book)	2009-11-21 14:21:26
678323	5927103946	@Ewan Your voting system's a lot easier than the scorecard. Tnx	2009-11-21 14:18:56
678323	5927052063	@ewan yes. and all that Idol drivel. Make them write their own songs, I say!	2009-11-21 14:16:31
678323	5926919157	@ewan I was Alice in my ballet recital (ahem! yrs ago). I know what that can do to a kid.	2009-11-21 14:10:35
678323	5926807646	@Michske I know! I absolutely love this singer	2009-11-21 14:05:29
678323	5926797878	@ewan yep. hence the wagon	2009-11-21 14:05:04
678323	5926789995	@ewan - btw, it's pure joy to hear Vikki here again, if only in asides...	2009-11-21 14:04:42
678323	5926764485	@ewan I do believe there is a syndrome there...	2009-11-21 14:03:33
678323	5926367335	.@Michske Absolutely! I'd love to see something like that here in US - but we're a bit more focused on sports, sadly	2009-11-21 13:45:19
678323	5926325750	@ewan at least there's no wondering about autotune...	2009-11-21 13:43:25
678323	5926253888	@Michske you ain't lyin'. I just love the commentary. It's interesting to see the variation in maturation. 15? wha?	2009-11-21 13:40:04
678323	5926163073	@ewan and where is the representation from anywhere in the UK, eh?	2009-11-21 13:35:47
678323	5926049089	@cc_chapman At the same time, Emily should be watching junior eurovision, I would think... http://bit.ly/8EOojY	2009-11-21 13:30:34
678323	5925909645	Well if Junior Eurovision can greet by bowing...  hehe #jesc	2009-11-21 13:24:15
678323	5925531294	.@Ewan Plus I'm getting a strong whiff of Martin and Akroyd and those two wild and crazy guys....	2009-11-21 13:06:47
678323	5925493950	@ewan This is my first "junior" one. some seem less junior than others...	2009-11-21 13:05:06
678323	5925448701	@Flemmingdoerken Only the brave. and those who know @ewan. I enjoy the culture shock myself.	2009-11-21 13:03:02
678323	5925414214	@tinnion And she's still at the shore. and not moving.	2009-11-21 13:01:30
678323	5925397210	Watching Junior Eurovision Song Contest (http://bit.ly/8EOojY) Can't help but feel it's a bit "JonBenet"-esque. Must repress cynicism STAT	2009-11-21 13:00:46
678323	5925319736	@tinnion We've got a screened-in area that we close up in winter. Dad built it, and it's always a challenge to get all the frames organized	2009-11-21 12:57:17
678323	5925112616	@tinnion She's best at making lists for us to do. I suspect w/e will be filled with the sound of us putting storm windows on the porch.	2009-11-21 12:47:41
678323	5924978362	@tinnion Haven't even tried the Kindle yet. (same problem of getting her to sit down)	2009-11-21 12:41:27
678323	5924941374	@tinnion The problem is getting her to sit down long enough to figure out what to do with the netbook. She's a bit of a force of nature...	2009-11-21 12:39:49
678323	5924919612	@tinnion we always have plenty to be thankful for, in spite of how it might seem...	2009-11-21 12:38:48
678323	5924721424	@tinnion she's not quite there yet. I'm hoping to make inroads during Thanksgiving. Wish me luck.	2009-11-21 12:29:55
678323	5924707382	@valerieinto Loving the poutine link (anything by Trillin is pure joy), Thanks!	2009-11-21 12:29:15
678323	5924641101	@tinnion Got Mom the ASUS and love it; we keep screen resolution low (for easy reading) but that makes for more scrolling	2009-11-21 12:26:13
678323	5923317580	@anniemal Did you notice all the fluids are different colors? For those who can't read, I'm told. Sobering.	2009-11-21 11:26:54
678323	5923282434	.@birdingbev Great reminder that birdwatching is not without risk. Even with visible orange I feel unsafe this time of the year in the woods	2009-11-21 11:25:23
678323	5923140837	@ewan - loving the yodeling, but I'm so oversated on pop that I have to take a break before the finals. AsianVarietyShow FTW! go, Bollywood!	2009-11-21 11:19:09
678323	5922989241	@iconjohn Thanks. We had a great year+ post-op, and she was a great therapy dog for my folks (and at least she outlived my father). Grateful	2009-11-21 11:12:27
678323	5922721273	@AmyZQuinn Just lost the best one ever, 3 weeks ago. Huge void right now, but I'll be ready soon. Rescues are the only option I'll go for.	2009-11-21 11:00:52
678323	5922644216	@threefromleith Please don't tell me they're in conversation with each other! (and wow! J's getting more lovely every day)	2009-11-21 10:57:34
678323	5922394178	@tinnion @deanwhitbread well, that was predictable, no?	2009-11-21 10:46:31
678323	5922199084	@iconjohn @jerseyshorejen @AmyZQuinn Thanks, folks. I was staving off Petfinder, but I'm back there again, thanks to this morning's tweets.	2009-11-21 10:37:54
678323	5922020684	@imnico Oh, crap. Sorry to hear that. sending good vibes southeastward.	2009-11-21 10:30:07

678323	5899893867	@paulcarr Where are the "buzzword bingo" cards? Add the phrases "in the weeds" and "let's park that" FTW	2009-11-20 14:46:00
678323	5898875837	@RobUsdin Thanks for that memory. I knew it looked familiar, but I couldn't figure out why (only having seen ads for that game back then)	2009-11-20 14:03:36

678323	5873004026	@cc_chapman Yes, and the other thing that's been too long is another Accident Mash, 'cept you can't really go home again. What fun that was!	2009-11-19 17:45:05
678323	5872887080	@HLChristaBelle I think it might have something to do with the redistribution of the fat layer under the skin - it's a definite phenomenon	2009-11-19 17:40:33
678323	5872825534	Considering my recent passion for Amazon's Subscribe&Save, I may be able to build a small greenhouse from those yards of puffy plasticbags.	2009-11-19 17:38:12

680873	5517168002	Don't think either deserves the belt based on that performance, I suspect Valuev will win on points.	2009-11-07 16:51:48

680873	5517051154	You cant win if your constantly on the back foot Hayes has to come forward. Valuev just not havin to do much, wonder what judges will think	2009-11-07 16:45:59
680873	5516865222	Three round left you can't run around for two minutes and hope to score off a couple of punches, Hayes corner should know better,	2009-11-07 16:36:45
