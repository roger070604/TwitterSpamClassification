# TwitterSpamClassification
In this project, a new adaptive hybrid feature model is proposed for twitter bot detection. This feature integrates traditional latent Dirichlet allocation(LDA)[1] document-topic feature and a couple of heuristic features including ratio of URL and tweet average length[2]. A series of experiments are conducted to evaluate this proposed featureâ€™s performance by increasing the training dataset from 0.5% to 90% out of the total dataset.  The result shows that this new feature adds some discriminative power to feature generation for bot detection, especially when the dataset size is relatively small.
